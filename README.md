# Day_Planner

## What this project is
This is a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day.

## Why I began this project
Building this calendar application will strengthen my skills in jQuery and saving data into localStorage

## How I implemented this project
Dynamically updated HTML stylized with CSS and powered by jQuery

## What I hope to eventually accomplish with this project
Implement reminder functionality that will alert the user at a specific time or after a specific interval of time
